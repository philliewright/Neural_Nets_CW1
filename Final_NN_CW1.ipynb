        "## Introduction\n",

        "In the modern, internet driven world, the threat landscape seen in online comments has grown increasingly worrysome and harmful. Polarisation in thinking is increasing and online harrassment for peoples opinions, beliefs and facets of their identity is a huge problem. These comments which can be harmful, offensive and disruptive can have sever impacts on the individuals and communities. We must tackle this problem in order to preserve the integrity and inclusivity of online spaces, in the form of content moderation.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are looking to help takle this problem by using Neural Networks to find and classify toxic comments of different types. Neural Netwroks have the ability to process and learn from huge datasets of text and will be a promising place to come at a solution from. We will be using multilabel classification to attempt to label the comments as either Toxic, Severely Toxic, Obscene, Threat, Insult and Identity hate. We hope this model will be a good start for a tool to maintain healthy online interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The origional source of the data is a collection of comments from Wikipedia's talk page edits. The dataset is the Toxic Comment Classification dataset from Kaggle, obtained using the following link:\n",
        "https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge\n",
        "Given the extensive nature of the dataset we feel it is a realistic cross section of the challenges which we'd expect to encouner in moderating real time online discussions.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are going to follow the methodical approach of Francois Chollet's universal workflow of Deep Learning which we detail below.[1] We want to build a functional model but also fully understand the details of how the neural networks work in the context of NLP.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be using Chollets universal workflow of Deep Learning as defined in 'Deep Learning with Python' which is a structured approach to developing deep learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "A summary of this workflow is given below:\n",
        "### 1. Define the Problem and Assemble a Dataset\n",
        "- **Understand the Problem**: We will outline what we are trying to achieve. This includes understanding the problem's nature (classification, regression, etc.) and its complexity. For this project, we are making a classification model.\n",
        "- **Collect a Dataset**: This step is to identify and gather the data we need and amke sure it's representative of the problem we are trying to solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Choose a Measure of Success\n",
        "- **Select an Evaluation Protocol and Loss Function**: We have decided to use accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. We will use the binary cross entropy a loss function, which our model will seek to minimize.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Determine the Evaluation Protocol\n",
        "- **Choose How to Evaluate the Model**: We will use k-fold cross-validation to further evaluate our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Prepare Your Data\n",
        "- **Data Preprocessing**: Format the data (normalization, vectorization, etc.) so that it can be fed into a neural network. This step includes splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Develop a Baseline Model\n",
        "- **Build a Small Model**: Start with a simple model (logistic regression) that can process the data and provide a baseline performance. This will mean we can have a point of comparison for more complex models later. We have decided to use a simple Logistic regression as our baseline model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Scale Up: Develop a Model That Overfits\n",
        "- **Build a Larger Model**: Once we have a baseline, we will build a more complex model capable of overfitting. This step is so that we push the limits to understand the capacity needed to solve the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Regularize and Tune Your Model\n",
        "- **Fight Overfitting**: Use techniques like dropout, regularisation, or feature reduction to mitigate overfitting.\n",
        "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust learning rates, batch sizes, number of layers/neurons, etc., to find the best performing model configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. Iterate on Your Model\n",
        "- **Refine the Model**: Based on the performance of the model, we will go back and make adjustments. This might include gathering more data, adjusting hyperparameters, or changing the architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. Evaluate the Final Model\n",
        "- **Test the Model**: Once the model performs well on the validation data, evaluate it on the test data to estimate how it will perform in the real world.\n"

The first model, despite its lower precision, is better at identifying a larger proportion of the actual positive cases.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Overfitting Concern**: The extremely high accuracy of the second model (nearly 100%) compared to its performance in precision, recall, and F1-score suggests potential overfitting. This means the model may be too closely tailored to the training data, reducing its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",

        "- **Data Preparation**: Ensure consistent data preparation steps for both models. If sparse formats were used successfully in the first model, consider applying similar techniques to the second model.\n",
        "- **regularisation and Dropout**: To prevent overfitting, especially for the second model, we could try to adjust regularisation parameters or dropout rates.\n",
        "- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Depending on the specific use case, consider which metrics are most crucial (e.g., is minimizing false positives more important than capturing as many true positives as possible? Also need to consider user impact) and adjust the model accordingly."
